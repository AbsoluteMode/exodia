# Local source customization

Start a coding harness in the source checkout. Read `AGENTS.md`, then run
`python3 scripts/customize.py discover --json` and `doctor --json`. The tool map
points to the source and focused checks; it is shared by all harnesses.

The complete procedure is [Customize Whytap](../../docs/customization/README.md).
It includes hover integration, JSON dashboard contracts and local data boundaries.
`build` and `run` use the stable beta development bundle. Scaffold commands only
create drafts, and existing output directories are rejected.

Build and test locally. The helpers do not publish, release, replace the installed
production app or modify user stores. Keep the source capability map current when
renaming an entry point, and regenerate `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` from
`.project-docs/agent-context.md` after changing shared guidance.
