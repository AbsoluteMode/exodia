## Decision

Settings → Integrations lists Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar, Apple Calendar
and Zoom Calendar separately. Each entry describes the actual calendar access,
shows its connection or approval state, and opens a provider-specific sheet.
Ordinary users do not enter OAuth client configuration. The later
[Calendar in Hover decision](2026-10-21-calendar-hover.md) moves Calendar's feed
controls and advanced source-user client setup into Hover.

Registration and production publishing status are not evidence of provider
approval. Shared Google and Zoom clients require an explicit packaging approval
flag before new browser sign-in can start, including from Planner. Missing or
malformed approval stays closed. Existing connections and local events remain
available; disconnection remains possible. A source user's independent native
client is separate from Whytap's shared registration.

Only set the public approval flag after the actual provider decision. Fixtures,
branding verification and a published domain do not justify that flag. See
[Google verification preparation](../../docs/google-calendar-verification.md).

The shared connection coordinator serializes Settings and Planner sign-in.
An active connection flow defers Sparkle restart and backup restore, including
when the originating window closes; ordinary backups remain available.
Conversely, backup work, a staged restore or pending maintenance blocks new
connection changes until it finishes, so restored metadata cannot erase a new
account. The native-client editor clears a previous client's desktop secret
when its ID changes.

## Why

The user wants to connect a capability with understandable permissions.
Provider-level account login must not suggest access to unrelated email,
recordings or transcripts. A clear pending state inside Whytap avoids sending
public users into the Google warning the user explicitly rejected.

Scoped integration buttons and links respond across their full area to hover,
press and keyboard focus; disabled controls stay visibly unavailable and inert.
This follows the user's interaction feedback requirement without changing
unrelated Settings controls.

## Verification limits

Synthetic tests and offscreen renders cover readiness, blocked browser launch,
connection serialization, restore/restart deferral, long labels, errors and
control states. Real provider approval and live consent are separate external
acceptance. No Google access was granted during the warning-screen check.
